230087778 - COM6017M - Internet of Things Project

The moto_theft is the main code for the project which is uploaded to the Arduino Uno R4 WiFi.

Ive also uploaded the library for the Edge AI model which was trained in edge impulse,
named moto_theft_detection_inferencing in the edge_ai_model folder.

On top of this the motion_detector code is what was used to gather data for training and testing.
